<p align="justify">Knowledge of the transient response characteristics of the Maglev plant is helpful in choosing the right specifications for control design. For instance, if we have an idea of the settling time of the Maglev plant, we can specify a smaller settling time for the closed loop system under feedback control, and thereby speedup the system. Again, a more oscillatory Maglev plant response means that more damping is to be specified for the closed loop system under feedback control</p>

<p align="justify">By varying the plant parameters and seeing their effects on the response, we can get an idea of the sensitivity of the output to the plant parameters. This idea is useful in designing more robust controllers capable of handling the variations in plant parameters.</p>

<p align="justify">It is the aim of this experiment to study the time response characteristics that provide useful information for subsequent control design studies. It should be noted that the transient response parameters can be calculated for the stable plant only.</p>
