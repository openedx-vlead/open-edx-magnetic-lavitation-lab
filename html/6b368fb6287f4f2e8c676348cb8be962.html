<p>The first Video shows the magnetic levitation system present in the Systems and Control Engineering Laboratory at IIT Bombay. Our simulation exerciseshave been designed based on this setup. The video shows the various subsystems, and demonstrates the levitation of the magnet. (acronyms used in the video: SISO is single input, single output, MISO is multi input multi output, SIMO is single input multi output, and MIMO is multi output multi output).</p>

<p>The second video shows various kinds of responses of the magnetic levitation system under PD control. We can see underdamped, overdamped, and critically damped responses of the maglev for different values of the PD parameters.(The PD values shown in the video may be different from the ones you calculate and use in the simulation exercises) </p>
