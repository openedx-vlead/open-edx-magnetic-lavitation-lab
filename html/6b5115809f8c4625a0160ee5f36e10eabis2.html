<p align="justify">A mathematical model of the Maglev plant enables us to study the steady state and dynamic characteristics of the plant. Once a good model is obtained, a suitable control law can be developed to improve the stability and performance of the system. We prefer to obtain a simple linear transfer function model of the Maglev plant, because it facilitates analytical design of PID controllers in the subsequent experiments.</p>
<p></p>
<p align="justify">We first develop a nonlinear mathematical model of the Maglev plant, based on fundamental laws of physics. The nonlinear model is linearized around an operating point using first order Taylor series expansion. The result is a second order linear model. The second order model is rearranged and put into the standard form of a second order transfer function. Then, the expressions for damping factor, natural frequency, and plant gain can be easily derived in terms of the physical parameters.</p>

<p align="justify">We shall study the effect of different values of the physical parameters on the standard second order model parameters like damping factor etc.. This is done via a simulation program based on these expressions.</p>
