<ol type="1">
<li>What two values does the control effort always take?</li>
<li>Why does the actual height overshoot or undershoot the setpoint?</li>
<li>Initially, before the height change is made, why is the controller output at its OFF value?</li>
<li>How do the oscillations (frequency and amplitude) in actual height response vary with the controller hysteresis?</li>
<li>How does the control effort (frequency and amplitude) vary with controller hysteresis?</li>
<li>How does the magnitude of deviations around the reference height vary with the controller hysteresis?</li>
