<p align="justify">The simplest feedback control strategy is On-Off Control. At the basic level, the strategy is based on the relay element, and maximum corrective action is taken for control. The strategy is quite simple to implement, and is widely found in day to day applications, such as water cooler temperature control systems. The simple relay based strategy is sensitive to large measurement noise, so a hysteresis element is usually added to the relay. The drawback of the method is that the output response can be quite oscillatory, with large amplitude deviations from the setpoint. The actuator also usually rapidly switches between Off and On positions, which may cause good amount of wear and tear.</p>

<p align="justify">In this experiment, we apply the On-off strategy to control the Maglev system. The aim is to levitate the magnet to a new desired height. We setup the various parameters of the controller, such as switching points (in terms of hysteresis), controller output values sin off and on modes, and upper and lower limits on the controller output. We obtain the closed loop input and output responses via simulations. The responses are analyzed for their characteristics, such as amplitude and frequency of output oscillations, output deviation from setpoint, and frequency of input actuator switching. We can vary the controller parameters and observe their effects on the response characteristics.</p>
