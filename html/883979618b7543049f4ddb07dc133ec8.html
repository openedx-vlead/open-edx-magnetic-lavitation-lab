<li>Actuators are required to supply the inputs to plants. A model of the actuator is therefore required to be developed along with that of the plant, if the model is to be useful for control design. What is the actuator for the Maglev system? Have we modeled it? If so, what is the model?</li>
</ol></ol>

<li>The output of the Maglev plant is the height or position. A measurement sensor is required to get the position for feedback. What kind of position sensor is used for the maglev system? Have we modeled it? If so, what is the model?</li>
</ol></ol>

<li>Is the plant gain of the maglev transfer function low or high? Will this be a problem for position measurement?</li>

<li>The term &ldquo;gravity offset&rdquo; is used for the initial control effort &laquo;math xmlns=&uml;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&uml;&raquo;&laquo;msub&raquo;&laquo;mi&raquo;u&laquo;/mi&raquo;&laquo;mn&raquo;0&laquo;/mn&raquo;&laquo;/msub&raquo;&laquo;/math&raquo;Why is it an appropriate term?</li>

<li>How can the magnetic force be made repulsive instead of attractive? How would the transfer function change for a repulsive force?</li>
