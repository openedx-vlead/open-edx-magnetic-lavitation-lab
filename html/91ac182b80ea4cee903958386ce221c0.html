<p align="justify">Next to the On-Off control strategy, the simplest control strategy is the one called proportional control strategy. In this strategy, the output of the controller is proportional to its input (which is usually the error signal). The control law therefore involves only the proportionality constant, called gain of the controller. There is no dynamic element in this controller. The proportional controller can be very simply implemented, as only a gain element (such as an op-amp) needs to be used. The P control strategy is used to provide (high) gain feedback around motors and amplifier systems, for instance.</p>

<p align="justify">In this experiment, weapply the P control strategy to the Maglev plant. We attempt to design a P controller so as to place the closed loop complex poles at desired locations in the complex plane. We see that P control can achieve only the desired imaginary part, but not the desired real part of the closed loop poles. We validate our design through closed loop simulation.</p>
