<p><b>Things to think about</b><br /> 1. For the maglev plant model only, what are the crossover frequencies w_gc,w_pc and the margins GM, PM? <br /> 2. Why is the closed loop system stable for some range of negative values of Kc ?<br /> (for example, Kc= -2000?) 3. Does the initial height affect the PM? (Hint: keep all values at default, and decrease). <br /> 4. Does the Bode phase plot change with Kc? Why?<br /> 5. How does increase in friction coefficient affect the PM?</p>
