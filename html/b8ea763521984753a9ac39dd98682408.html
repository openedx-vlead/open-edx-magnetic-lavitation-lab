<ol type="1">
<li>For a given Kc , is the location of the closed loop poles dependent on the initial height y0 of the magnet. If yes, how?</li>
<li>What are the grey color curves in the pole-zero maps?</li>
<li>What happens when the Kc value is negative?</li>
<li>Do negative values of Kc mean that feedback is positive, instead of negative?</li>
<li>Can you derive the formula for Kc to get real closed loop poles? Are the real poles always such that one is positive, and the other negative?</li>
</ol>
