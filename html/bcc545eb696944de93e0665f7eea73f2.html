<ol type="1">
<li>Does the speed of maglev plant response change with viscous friction? Why?</li>
<li>How is the natural frequency related to the speed of response (settling time or rise time)? Is the relation direct or inverse?</li>
<li>Is the transfer function of the Maglev plant stable for all parameter variations possible in the UI?</li>
<li>Which parameter has the maximum effect on overshoot?</li>
<li>Which parameter has the maximum effect on plant gain?</li>
</ol>
