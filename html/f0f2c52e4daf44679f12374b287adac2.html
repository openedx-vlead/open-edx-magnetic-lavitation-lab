<p>The frequency response of a system expresses how a sinusoidal signal of a given frequency on the systeminput is transferred through the system. Signals inthe system, such as the reference (setpoint) signal, disturbance signal, or measurement signals which areinputs signals to signal filters, consist of several frequency components. Each frequency component is a sinusoidal signal having certain amplitude and phase. Somecomponents may be amplified, others may be attenuated, and there will besome phase lag through the system.The frequency response expresses how each ofthese frequency components is transferred through the system.<br /> Among the three domains- frequency, time, and Laplace domains, often the best controller designs are obtained in the frequency domain. Hence, frequency domain is a commonly used and preferred domain for control design. The basic information in this domain is the magnitude and phase values (or real and imaginary parts) of the frequency response at each frequency. These can be easily obtained from a given transfer function model, and shown in the form of Bode, Nyquist, or Nichols plots. From these plots, we can find the stability (gain-phase) margins, which give us an idea how stable the system will be under feedback control.<br /> For the Maglev plant, we obtain the frequency responses (in terms of Bode, Nyquist, and Nichols plots) for various values of proportional gain. We observe the variations in stability margins with P gain. We use this study to design a P controller for achieving desired gain-phase margins.</p>
