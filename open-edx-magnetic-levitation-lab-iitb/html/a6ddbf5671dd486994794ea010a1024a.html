<p>In this experiment, we study the time response characteristics of the Maglev plant model (without any controller) to a unit step input, in control theory , it is also known as the &ldquo;Open Loop Step Response&rdquo;. The response characteristics studied are the rise time, settling time, peak overshoot. We also study the effect of the various plant parameters on these response characteristics.</p>
