<p>The aim of this experiment is to learn how to derive a transfer function model of the magnetic levitation (Maglev) plant. The Maglev transfer function is put in a standard second order form, and expressions are obtained for the damping factor, natural frequency, and steady state (DC) gain in terms of the physical parameters. The effect of different physical parameter values on the damping etc. is studied via a simulation program based on these expressions.</p>
